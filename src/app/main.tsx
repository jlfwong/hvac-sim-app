      <p>
        To end climate change, we Canadians need to stop burning fossil fuels
        inside our homes. But for all of us that heat our homes with gas
        furnaces, what are we supposed to do?{" "}
        <strong style={{ color: "#1D82F8" }}>Freeze</strong>?
      </p>

      <p>
        No, of course not. Thankfully, we have a modern solution to{" "}
        <strong style={{ color: "#89C606" }}>all-electric</strong> heating
        that’s way more cost-efficient than baseboard heaters. They’re called{" "}
        <strong style={{ color: "#F8861D" }}>heat pumps</strong>.
      </p>

      <img src="/images/heatpump-hero.webp" />

      <p>
        In the last decade, heat pumps have gotten way more efficient in cold
        climates. They're ready for the Canadian winters—6% of Canadian homes
        already use them.
      </p>

      <p>
        Replacing a gas furnace with a heat pump in your home is one of the most
        effective ways of reducing your emissions, and in many parts of Canada,
        it'll save you $$$ too.
      </p>

      <p>
        Want to estimate costs and emissions savings for your own home? Great!
        We built a calculator for you to help. Just enter in some basic
        information about your home:

                Now we run a simulation. At each point in time, we use weather
                information and the simulated temperature inside the house to
                calculate the thermal loads on the house.

                Using a simulated thermostat, the simulation turns heating and
                cooling appliances on and off. The passive thermal loads on the
                house and the thermal loads from the heating and cooling
                appliances are then used to update the internal air temperature.
              </p>
              <p>
                As we&rsquo;re recording appliances turning on and off, we
                record how much energy they&rsquo;re using. We use provincial
                gas and electricity prices from 2023 to estimate costs.
